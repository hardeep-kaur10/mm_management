mess management system

In this project, we implemented a webapp using python with django framework.. The mess 
worker or mess manager will be given a separate role in the app through which they can approve 
those requests.

In Todayâ€™s world the entire Mess Management and costing calculations are done manually to 
date. It is very time consuming & increases the chances of performing calculation mistakes. 
Thus, there arises a need to create software that will make the entire Mess Management an 
automated system.

The MealMaster project aims to develop a web-based application using Django, a Python web 
framework, to streamline and automate the management of mess operations in educational 
institutions. The system will provide a user-friendly interface for three types of users: owners, 
staff members, and students.

Owners will have the ability to send notifications, reply to feedback, manage staff leaves, and 
review mess requests from students. Staff members can view and respond to notifications and 
feedback, mark attendance, generate bills, and apply for leaves. Students can access their 
profiles, view notifications, provide feedback, apply for mess off leave, and view bills and 
attendance records. 

The system will also include features such as menu management, attendance tracking. With this 
system, the aim is to improve efficiency, accuracy, and transparency in managing mess-related 
tasks, enhancing the overall dining experience for students and simplifying administrative tasks 
for staff and owners.

The aim of the Mess Management System project is to develop a web-based application that 
automates and streamlines the management of mess operations in educational institutions. The 
system aims to provide a convenient and efficient platform for owners, staff members, and 
students to perform various tasks related to mess management.
